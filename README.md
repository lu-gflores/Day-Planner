## Description

Time management is one of the key skills a web developer must have in order to maintain their professional status and be successful in their career. This calendar application allows a developer or another type of worker to maintain an hourly schedule (from 9AM to 5PM, a common 8 hour shift) by inputting their events each hour so that they can manage their time more effectively. It also allows users to save their events in local storage so that it loads in their browswer once re-opened.  This application is powered by a dynamically updated HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap framework as well as jQuery that updates the time blocks based on the current and store user events.
